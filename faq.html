								<h4>What should I wear to a boxing workout?</h4>
								<p>We recommend wearing anything that makes you feel confident, especially workout apparel and shoes that you’re comfortable sweating in. We have gloves to borrow for your first time and you can purchase hand wraps here or bring your own.</p>

								<hr />
								<h4>What should I bring to class?</h4>
								<p>We have gloves to borrow for your first time and you can purchase hand wraps here or bring your own. Hand wraps are required to use during class to protect your hands and wrists. We encourage you to bring a water bottle and to drink plenty of water during and after class. The most important thing to bring with you is the attitude and belief that you can do anything you set your mind to.</p>

								<hr />
								<h4>I don’t own a pair of boxing gloves and kit. Will I need to buy them?</h4>
								<p>We have gloves that you can borrow for your trial class. We make sure they’re cleaned and disinfected thoroughly after each class and replaced often. We recommend purchasing your own gloves after your first class. Best of all,  our academy members get a discount on gloves and wrap purchases.</p>

								<hr />
								<h4>Will I get hurt?</h4>
								<p>With all physical activity, there are risks. We encourage you to speak with a doctor before performing physical activity. As it pertains to our classes, we wrap your hands to prevent injury and show you the basic punches and exercises throughout class. If at any time you need assistance or more direction all you have to do is ask! The trainers interact with every person in class, not just stand up front like other gyms and studios, so it’s easy to ask question as you go. We can offer modifications as well. To put your mind at ease: you will never get hit in one of our classes. We are a no-contact workout.</p>

								<hr />
								<h4>What if I fall behind the rest of the class?</h4>
								<p>Our workouts are for all ages, all abilities and all fitness levels. Every participant in class is encouraged to go at their own pace. If you need to stop, catch your breath, stretch or get a drink of water, it’s no big deal – everyone does it! Hop back in when you’re ready and we’ll be there right next to you cheering you on!</p>
